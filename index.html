<h1>Where is the internet?! </h1>


      

		 

<p>It is easy to regard the internet as invisible; as a cloud floating above our heads. This, however, is far from the truth!</p>

<p>When you post a letter, the employer obviously does not take the letter and deliver it directly across the country or world to its receiver. Instead, it goes to your local post office where it is then passed along to post office after post office until it reaches its destination. This can be used as an analogy for how we receive information through the internet. Instead of mail, data packets are sent, and instead of taking days or weeks to take its journey, these packets are sent across the world in <i>milliseconds!</i> </p>

  <p><b>HOW?!</b></p>

    
    
<p>How does my friend, who is currently in Paris, send me an email from her laptop which I receive  almost instantaneously <i>19,000 Km</i> away on my iPhone screen in Wellington?!</p>

<p>To understand this, it is important to think of the internet as a global collection of networks that are interconnected and communicate using protocols. There are many different types of networks, and they can all connect to one another. The most common form of internet connection is through wires, wether it be DSL lines or finer optic cables. There are hundreds of thousands of kilometres of wires laid around the world! Most of which are underground and undersea (fun fact: there is more than enough communications cable underwater to get to the <i>moon and back!</i>). This is the fastest form of internet network communications, with data being able to travel up to <i>70% the speed of light</i> in fibre optic cables! This is faster than satellite internet, because instead of data simply travelling across earth to the destination, the data has to travel up to the satellites and back down to earth, covering a much larger distance. Cellular internet is a more recent form of internet, which communicate data through cell towers before connecting to physical wires and the other forms of internet.</p> 

<p>When my friend clicked ‘send’ on the email, the NIC (Network Interface Card) on her laptop used wifi to send the data which constitutes the email to the WAP (Wireless Access Point) which passes the data on to the local router through wires. It is important to note that the data breaks up into different packets which don’t necessarily take the same path. The data in these packets include the IP address of the sender and receiver. The devision of data into data packets is what makes internet systems so fast and reliable, because if one pathway becomes overused, the packets can simply take a different path. Like described above in the post analogy, the data packets pass from one router to another, transferring through underwater cables and arriving at at a Google data centre here in NZ (I’m a gmail user). When I open the email, the data packets are further transferred through multiple routers and lines until it reaches the router of my home and uses the WAP to reach the Soc (System on Chip) on my iPhone via Wifi, where the data packets reassemble and appear as an email on my screen!</p>

<p>Next time you're viewing a youtube video uploaded in America, recieving a facebook message from Auckland or viewing an instagram photo posted in Greece, think about the infrastructure involved. Think about the data pockets travelling through undersea fibre optic cables and hopping across routers. It truly is amazing, and (suprisingly?) <b>visible!!!</b></p>
